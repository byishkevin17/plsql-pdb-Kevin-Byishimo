Introduction

This report presents the practical work completed on Oracle Database Creation, Deletion, and Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) configuration. The objective of the assignment was to create a pluggable database (PDB) that will be used for storing class work, demonstrate how to delete another PDB, and finally configure and access Oracle Enterprise Manager to monitor database performance. These tasks were designed to help understand how Oracleâ€™s multitenant architecture operates and how database administration can be efficiently managed using OEM.

TASK 2: Create and Delete a PDB
ðŸ”¹ Create another PDB (for deletion demo)
Open it
